<h1>About Us</h1>

	<p>Hastings Carpet Cleaning is a locally owned business operating in the Port Macquarie Hastings area for over 10 years. As a family owned business, you deal directly with the owners, every time. From your initial phone call or email enquiry to the end of the job, you are dealing with the people who will be cleaning your carpets.</p>

	<p>We are a <a href="http://www.woolsafe.org/australia/">WoolSafe</a> accredited business, and owner/operator Geoff is fully trade qualified. We service residential carpets &amp; upholstery, and are also specialists in commercial carpet care.</p>

<h2>Services</h2>
	
	<p>In addition to being the local experts in residential carpet and upholstery cleaning, we are also trained in:</p>

	<ul id="training">
		<li>Commercial carpet and upholstery cleaning</li>
		<li>Advanced stain removal</li>
		<li>Leather lounge cleaning</li>
		<li>Mattress cleaning</li>
		<li>Allergy and dust mite advice and treatment</li>
		<li>Odour control</li>
		<li>Carpet colour repair and restoration</li>
		<li>Water damage mitigation</li>
		<li>Carpet dry cleaning</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Qualifications</h2>

	<p>We are fully trade qualified professionals, holding a Certificate III qualification in Asset Maintenance Carpet Cleaning, which involves 24 months of hands-on training. The qualification ensures competency in many areas including OH&amp;S, carpet and fabric identification, carpet and upholstery cleaning methods and chemistry, advanced stain removal, leather lounge cleaning, odour control, spot dying, and water damage mitigation. This qualification is quite different to a carpet cleaning certification which may be advertised by other carpet cleaners in that the latter is a one to two day course with a completion certificate.</p>

WoolSafe is an international organisation whose accreditation program for experienced carpet cleaners involves study and understanding structure and chemistry of carpet fibres, carpet maintenance, carpet construction, and carpet cleaning.

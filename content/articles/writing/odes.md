Summary: My notes on ordinary differential equations.

I took a course in ordinary differential equations (and vector calculus) in early 2014, and wrote up some summary notes for finals revision. They're not spectacular — they really only contain stuff that I happened to write up — but hey, maybe someone will find them useful. They're [here]({filename}/pdfs/ordinary_differential_equations.pdf) if you want to read them! I make no guarantees as to the accuracy of the content as this course was my first introduction to ODEs.

These notes are heavily based upon the 2014 MATH2405 lectures (D. Wickramasinghe), and Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems (W. E. Boyce & R. C. DiPrima).

I plan to revise them at some point in the future now that I have more experience with ODEs.

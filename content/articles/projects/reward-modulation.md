Summary: My first undergraduate research project in machine learning.

[Buck Shlegeris](http://bshlgrs.github.io) and I worked together on a reading course/research project in 2014, using Theano to perform various machine learning tasks, with the end goal of figuring out whether smoothly changing the cost function over time from a supervised to an unsupervised form would be more effective than switching suddenly halfway through learning (or not switching at all). This was the first academic project I've done, and it was neat teaching ourselves machine learning and also learning to write a decent final report. Neither of us had any background in machine learning at all, so essentially the project became a crash course in that.

Our results weren't that interesting for a wide range of reasons, but you can read an updated version of my final report [here]({filename}/pdfs/reward_modulation_denoising_autoencoders.pdf). I've since learned considerably more about the topic, and I'm still finding it pretty interesting!

This work was also published in [Cross-sections, The Bruce Hall Academic Journal - Volume XI](http://eview.anu.edu.au/cross-sections-the-bruce-hall-academic-journal/cross-sections-the-bruce-hall-academic-journal-volume-xi.html).

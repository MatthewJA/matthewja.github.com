Summary: A JavaScript computer algebra system.

[Coffeequate](coffeequate.rtfd.org) is a computer algebra system for JavaScript. It can manipulate algebraic expressions, and solve and simplify equations. It can also do simple differentiation, and propagate uncertainties. We plan to eventually add support for trigonometry and logarithms, as well as more complicated equations.

You can read more about Coffeequate [here](coffeequate.rtfd.org), or look at the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/MatthewJA/Coffeequate). Maintained by myself and [Buck Shlegeris](http://bshlgrs.github.io).

Summary: My second undergraduate research project.

This semester, I worked on a research project in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). IRL is basically this: You have an agent exhibiting some behaviour that optimally maximises some reward, and you want to find what reward it's maximising. There's a few reasons you might want to do that; the main reasons that I can think of are that you may want the reward as a proxy for the motivation of the agent, and that you may want to reproduce the behaviour of the agent using reinforcement learning.

It was an interesting project and I learned a lot about reinforcement learning, as well as implemented some algorithms from the inverse reinforcement learning literature. You can read my final report [here](http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/CSPROJECTS/15S2/Reports/Matthew_Alger_Report.pdf) and the code [here](https://github.com/MatthewJA/Inverse-Reinforcement-Learning).

Summary: A frustrating browser game.

[Circle Snake]({filename}/misc/snake/index.html) is a browser game I made while learning JavaScript. You can play it [here]({filename}/misc/snake/index.html). It's not a spectacular example of my code, but it's pretty fun! The code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/MatthewJA/Circle-Snake).

The highest score I'm aware of is 36.

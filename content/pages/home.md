![Matthew Alger]({filename}/images/me.jpg){.lead}

Hello! I'm **Matthew Alger**. I program things, and I study computer science and physics at the Australian National University. I like to write Python, and I occasionally write Haskell, JavaScript, or (regretfully) PHP.

This site is a bit of a work in progress, but so is everything, so that's okay.

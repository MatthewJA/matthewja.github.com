					<h3>Coffeequate</h3>
					<img class="thumb" src="/Coffeequate/images/coffeequate_small.png" alt="Coffeequate">
					<p><a href="/Coffeequate/">Coffeequate</a> is a computer algebra system (CAS) for JavaScript. It can manipulate algebraic expressions, and solve and simplify equations. It can also do simple differentiation, and propogate uncertainties. We plan to eventually add support for trigonometry and logarithms, as well as more complicated equations.</p>

					<p>You can read more about Coffeequate <a href="/Coffeequate/">here</a>, or look at the code <a href="http://github.com/MatthewJA/Coffeequate">here</a>. Maintained by myself and <a href="http://bshlgrs.github.io/">Buck Shlegeris</a>.</p>

				<h2>Things I've Written</h2>

				<section id="denoising-autoencoders">
					<h3>Investigating Reward-Modulation in Denoising Autoencoders</h3>
					<img class="thumb" src="/static/da_small.png" alt="Denoising Autoencoders">
					<p><a href="http://bshlgrs.github.io/">Buck Shlegeris</a> and I worked together on a reading course/research project in 2014, using <a href="http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/">Theano</a> to perform various machine learning tasks, with the end goal of figuring out whether smoothly changing the cost function over time from a supervised to an unsupervised form would be more effective than switching suddenly halfway through learning (or not switching at all). This was the first academic project I've done, and it was neat teaching ourselves machine learning and also learning to write a decent final report. Neither of us had any background in machine learning at all, so essentially the project became a crash course in that.</p>

					<p>Our results weren't that interesting for a wide range of reasons, but you can read my final report <a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/CSPROJECTS/14S2/Reports/Matthew_Alger_Report.pdf">here</a> for the foreseeable future. I've since learned considerably more about the topic, and I'm still finding it pretty interesting!</p>

					<h3>Ordinary Differential Equations</h3>
					<img class="thumb" src="/static/odes_small.png" alt="Ordinary Differential Equations">
					<p>I took a course in ordinary differential equations (and vector calculus) in early 2014, and wrote up some summary notes for finals revision. They're not spectacular &mdash; they really only contain stuff that I happened to write up &mdash; but hey, maybe someone will find them useful. They're <a href="/files/Ordinary_Differential_Equations.pdf">here</a> if you want to read them! I make no guarantees as to the accuracy of the content (this course was my first introduction to ODEs).</p>

					<p>These notes are heavily based upon the 2014 MATH2405 lectures (D. Wickramasinghe), and Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems (W. E. Boyce &amp; R. C. DiPrima).</p>

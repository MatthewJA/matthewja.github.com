"Go to a comic.",

"FACT.",

"This is a great idea.",
"Maybe that kind of coloring would be good for print cost?",
"Anya's Ghost did an amazing job with it.",
"Another book I can think of that did this is Bookhunter, using brown.",
"Yeah, I know.",
"But I'm not sure it'd be exactly good for sales if you have the colored version online and a black and white one on the market.",
"Unless you get someone really really really bad to do the colors.",

"Please leave a link to the song so we can hear it, nobody wants to search for songs not knowing what they'll find.",
"YouTube/streaming preferred.",
"A few, but again, they're mostly incest.",
"Looks like you already got a taker though, which is good.",
"My stories are gross, lol.",
"I do a lot of trolling on the chans using made up scenarios (ie \"This and this happened, what do I do?\")",
"so I've got a lot of scenarios floating around my head.",
"Heck, one actually later became my comic Third Degree.",
"But most of the scenarios involve incest.",
"Don't judge me.",
"Oh yeah I forgot traded pokemon level up faster.",
"I haven't actually played a pokemon game since the original G/S.",
"But the reason I wanted at least lvl 10 is because I wasn't expecting to actually find one for a while (took 2 days) and my other pokemon would be growing at a rate where it sucks making the Vulpix catch up.",
"But yeah I forgot about the lvl boost until I used it in battle, lol.",
"Yeah you can call me lazy, but I just was expecting to get one that was caught in the wild, and they're not lvl1.",
"Didnt want to train it so much longer than necessary.",
"I didn't even know what you were talking about, lol.",
"I just wanted a Vulpix.",
"God Pokemon has gotten a lot deeper than I remember.",
"Don't worry about it, I got one off site.",
"Thanks though.",
"I like Child of Apophis.",
"Since you said she was orphaned, how about Orphan of Apophis?",
"There's always the obscure title that only has cameos in the story.",
"Maybe she has a lucky charm that she uses.",
"Like a lucky 50 cent coin, in which you can call it Half Dollar or Kennedy.",
"Or it could have a name that has nothing to do with the comic.",
"Look at Cloverfield and Pulp Fiction, just to name a couple off the top of my head.",
"Does opening furry threads and saving furry pics and stuff make me a furry at all?",
"Because I see a lot of illicit furry pics on the net, and more often then not, they're just humans bodies with dog faces and maybe a tail.",
"I don't get it, really.",
"But a lot of the art is actually amazingly good.",
"If I pretend the horse faces aren't there I can rub one off no problemo.",
"Those are stickies.",
"They stay at the top of the board no matter what, until a mod un-sticky's them.",
"This was always my favorite joke in any comic I've made.",
"Sadly, only a few people actually understood it.",
"If you have a level ten, then Hell Yes.",
"Don't go out of your way to train the crap out of that lvl 1 one though.",
"That kind of effort is unnecessary for what I have to offer.",
"Level 1?",
"How does that exist?",
"Egg hatching?",
"I want at least a level 10.",
"That's waaaay more grinding than I'm comfortable with.",
"Thanks though.",
"What the hell is wrong with you.",
"I said I wanted Vulpix.",
"Get out of my thread.",
"(just kidding)",
"Trade amongst yourselves",
"Yeah I guess.",
"Well, I want a Vulpix.",
"I'm only 3 badges in and I have no fire pokemon still and want a Ninetails eventually so I'm gonna need to start with a Vulpix and Vulpix isn't in Heart Gold so I need someone with another game to trade me Vulpix.",
"As I said I'm only 3 badges in so my Pokeymens are only like lvl 19 and stuff.",
"I want to get rid of my Spearow named De Nearow(GET IT?)",
"so if anybody has a Vulpix they don't use and/or wants a Spearow or another lower level pokemon because I'm only 3 badges in, let me know, k?",
"Last movie I saw in theaters was Kung Fu Panda 2.",
"And it was awesome.",
"Dreamworks seems to be finally not sucking recently.",

"And How to Train Your Dragon was real good too.",
"I have no idea how the hell that game got so popular.",
"I'm actually seeing T-shirts and plushies in video stores.",
"It's not a bad game but..",
"It's a slingshot game.",
"Wtf wtf wtf.",
"Well, since I was dared.",

"Cartoony was always more my thing.",
"Suddenly he looks like he's in his mid-30's.",
"I haven't read any of your comic aside from a few pages, and I never had any idea she was wearing any kind of suit, spandex or otherwise.",
"It looks like she's just naked with gloves and boots.",
"So... Delicate sensibilities?",
"I'm far from delicate when it comes from the kinds of things I look at.",
"It should just be common sense to not show that kind of stuff in public, even with an excuse like 'its spandex lololol'.",
"What the Hell malls do you go to?",
"Short skirts?",
"I've seen them.",
"Prominent nipples?",
"Seen those too.",
"THAT shit?",
"A man can dream, though.",
"I know nudity is allowed in comics and all...",
"But I don't think it's allowed in the forums...",
"I could be wrong.",
"But yeah.",
"Wow, that's a ton of comics.",
"You've already got the whole comic done with?",
"With 15+ chapters worth of comics to update, 2 updates a day doesn't seem like a whole lot.",
"I personally don't think you're going too fast, if you've already got it done.",
"This actually sounds pretty cool.",
"I'd love to work on it, but I got two comics already.",
"One updates weekly and the other every day I finish one(which has been every day period)",
"I'd LOVE to work on this if there weren't already two I'm working on.",
"What kind of update schedule are you thinking of?",
"If it's weekly and with a simplistic style like Scott Pilgrim's, I'd love to do it.",
"Take a peek at my two comics I've got running now(in sig) for art samples.",
"I browse from my iPod Touch all the time.",
"There's no need for an app, the site feels totally natural on Safari.",
"I use GIMP, and it gives you an option of what quality you want the picture saved as.",
"I save all my stuff in .jpg format, and the quality bar is always at 85% by default.",
"I just slide it to 100% and save it.",
"Haven't noticed any major jpg artifacts yet, but who knows.",
"Thanks a lot.",
"I hope it keeps your attention all the way through",
"I know what it is, only because it was on the news about Harry Potter's crazy ass fandom back when it was still new and this huge fad.",
"That whole fandom kind of dwindled away, I mean, not completely, but it's nothin like what it was.",
"I'm both relieved and disappointed by this.",
"I loved the books I read up to the time, but the fandom was waaay out there.",
"People are still posting in this thread?",
"Drew a Baby Mario head... And had no idea what to do with it.",

"My apologies for generalizing the whole strip based on the few I read.",
"I'm on mobile right now but I fully intend on reading the rest when I get home.",
"I actually thought most of the fart jokes were pretty funny.",
"The yoga one made me lol.",
"As did the reason behind Dragynn farting so much needing to be repressed.",
"But it's obviously a furry comic, and I know what a majority of furries like, and with the amount of explicitly described farting/shitting jokes, it leads me to think of something else you might like, which frankly, I can't get out of my head now.",
"I can just repress that thought myself though, as the actual humor seems to be good spirited.",
"I'm not trying to be judgemental or anything, I'm simply stating that, well, if someone likes to eat pasta they're mostly going to cook pasta.",
"In short, I think you should ease up on the fart/shit jokes just a little bit.",
"Its a little redundant seeing the same joke in every other comic, and nobody likes to have feces shoved down their throats.",
"No hate if you do though.",
"To each his own.",
"Thanks.",
"I'm hoping it's not too disturbing though.",
"That wasn't my intention, it just has to be that way as I introduce Chris and the plot.",
"I'm the 22 year old that spends his time watching cartoons/anime, reading comics/manga, and playing video games.",

"I make a bunch of quick thumbnail pages in a notebook I use for references later, but that takes a while longer than what goes on in my head.",
"I should get the major plot points down somewhere before I forget them and have no idea where to go with the comic.",
"That's a really vague and confusing way to introduce yourself.",
"Jerk.",
"(that was a joke)",
"(but very poorly executed)",
"(and potentially offensive)",
"(in which case, i'm sorry)",
"A 16 year old Christopher West is involved in a car wreck in rural Indiana, leaving his closest friends dead, and his body and face covered in terrible scars.",
"Fast-forward to present day, we find a now 22-year-old Chris living alone as a shut-in in Chicago.",
"He stopped talking to his family back home, he stopped trying to make friends, he's on medication for headaches and depression.",
"Ashamed of his burns, he grows his hair out to cover them from the judgemental public's eye.",
"After getting back in contact with his sister Samantha after 3 years, she comes all the way to Chicago to visit.",
"But she's got a strange new affection for him that she can't keep to herself any longer.",
"After things get taken too far, Chris is riddled with guilt and must cope with his actions and the effects they've had on his family and mental health.",
"Updates Tuesdays and Thursdays.",
"How could he do voice acting on the original Flintstones when the show was finished before he was born?",
"What I'm wondering is if the cereal's still going to exist.",
"It's marketed for kids right now using the Flinstones' characters.",
"If the show turns into sex and toilet humor, what's going to happen to the cereal and it's marketing?",
"Name change?",
"Pretend Macfarlane's Flinstones doesn't exist?",
"The guy behind Family Guy, American Dad, and The Cleveland Show",
"A lot of you probably know this by now, but Seth Macfarlane has recently acquired the rights to produce a Flinstones tv series reboot to begin airing on FOX in a couple years.",
"A few sources say that the humor will be more raunchy, along the lines of his other shows.",
"My question is...",
"If the humor turns into nothing but sex and fart jokes... What's going to happen to Fruity Pebbles cereal?",
"Where's everybody seeing the redesigns?",
"First post's image won't show for me for some reason, and I can't find any of them on Google.",
"I feel like I'm missing out!",
"I find it much easier to juggle work and comics rather than school and comics.",
"Reason is simple.",
"No homework.",
"A way I've tried to do it is to make as many comics as you can in your free time, and set the extra ones to release later.",
"This way you have a little breathing room for schoolwork.",
"I used to just make the comic the same day I put it out.",
"That led to really screwed up schedules.",
"Haha, now you see just how bad it is that I haven't really posted until yesterday.",
"I used to do the music thing too when I showered in the morning.",
"It's too hot to do that now so I take forever at night instead of rushing.",
"Much more satisfying.",
"I jerk off constantly everywhere but the shower.",
"Even at work.",
"Jerking off in the shower's gross.",
"Jizz is a lot harder to wash off than I thought.",
"Hah, thanks.",
"The light hurts, but I'll adjust.",
"Everyone says I take really long showers.",
"I usually take about 20-30 minutes.",
"I don't know why I take so long, I can't even imagine how to make it shorter.",
"It's not like I stand there staring blankly at the wall or anything.",
"I'm lathering and scrubbing goddammit, how can you not take 20-30 minutes?",
"Oh wow, that was back in the day!",
"Nostalgia' pretty hard.",
"Thanks for clearing that up, lol.",
"Thanks, guy.",
"I don't know why I never post.",
"Like 500% of my post attempts end in me hitting the Back button for no reason at all.",
"Hopefully I can change that someday.",
"It says in my Profile that I have one post...",
"But I have no idea where or when that was.",
"Introducing myself, because I've been trying to participate in the community in some way, but could never find anything relevant to say.",

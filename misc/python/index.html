# Python: A Crash Course in Programming

Slides: [http://matthewja.com/misc/python](http://matthewja.com/misc/python)

---

# A brief introduction

Programming:
- I have a computer
- I want to make the computer do things for me
  - I need to use a programming language to tell it how to do the things

Programming languages:
- Can be specialised .sidenote[(e.g. R for statistics)] or general-purpose
- Formal, meaning that grammar matters

Python:
- General-purpose programming language
- *De facto* standard language used for machine learning, statistics, physics, biology, AI, ...
- Powers Reddit, Bitbucket, Dropbox, Sublime Text, BitTorrent, Blender, Sage, Linux, Civilization IV, Django, Blender, GIMP, YouTube...

# What we're going to do

We're going to learn how to do basic things in Python:
- Make decisions
- Do things repeatedly
- Work with data
- Use NumPy to work with data *better*
- Use MatPlotLib to make pretty pictures of data
- Read documentation

After this, you should have some background to help you out when you need to solve a programming task.

---

# Outline

- Fundamentals
- Types, lists, strings, and methods
- Expressions, `print`
- `if`, `while`, and `for`
- Files and data
- NumPy
- MatPlotLib

## Installing Python

You should have Python 3.5 already installed. If you don't:
- Windows: [Download and run this installer.](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1-amd64.exe)
- Mac OS X: [Download and run this installer.](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1-macosx10.6.pkg)
- Linux: You probably already have Python!

## Running Python

1. Open IDLE3 or IDLE.
2. You're running Python

---

## Getting around IDLE

.rightimg[![Shell](shell.png)]

### Shell

This is the shell. You can use it to *interact* with Python code that you've already written.

How do you interact with it? ...With more Python code. **:D**

You can enter **expressions** into it and Python will evaluate them, then tell you the answer (in blue).

## Getting around IDLE

.rightimg[![File editor](editor.png)]

### File editor

In the shell window: File > New File

This is where you write code. Save files with a `.py` file extension (you'll have to type it in yourself) and you'll get **syntax highlighting**.

---

layout: false

# Comments

Lines that start with a `#` are ignored by Python. You can (and should) use this to describe how your code works to anyone reading your code.

```python
# This is a comment
# This is another comment
# Python is pretty good

some_code_here()  # I can also put comments at the end of lines of code
```

---

layout: true

# Basics

---

Programming is a glorified way of manipulating **values**. Different kinds of values have different **types** and are represented in different ways.

```python
1  # int
1.0  # float
"hello"  # str
True  # bool
```

---

You can combine values with **operators** to make new values.

```python
1 + 2  # is 3
1.0 + 2  # is 3.0
1 / 2  # is 0.5
"hello" + "world"  # is "helloworld"
True and False  # is False
```

Operators work on different types. `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` work on numbers in ways you would expect; `and` and `or` work on `bool`s and let you do logic.

(also there's heaps more operators)

---

.rightimg[![Shell basics](shell2.png)]

You can try this out in the shell.

# Strings

Strings are sequences of characters.

```python
"hello"
"world"
"this is me"
```

You can add them together. You can also slice them:

```python
"this is me"[0]  # "t"
"this is me"[1]  # "h"
"this is me"[1:3]  # "hi"
```

If you just put a single number in the brackets, you will get a single character back. Note that `0` is the first character.

If you put two numbers separated by `:`, you will get multiple characters back. If you put in `[i:j]`, you will get back the `i`th character up to (but *not including*) the `j`th character.

---

# Lists

Lists are sequences of values. They can have whatever you want in them and be as long as you like.

```python
[1, 2, 3]
["hello", "world", "this is me"]
[1, 2, "hello", "world"]
[True, True, False]
[]
```

# Python: A Crash Course in Programming

Slides: [http://matthewja.com/misc/python](http://matthewja.com/misc/python)

---

# A brief introduction

Programming:
- I have a computer
- I want to make the computer do things for me
  - I need to use a programming language to tell it how to do the things

Programming languages:
- Can be specialised .sidenote[(e.g. R for statistics)] or general-purpose
- Formal, meaning that grammar matters

Python:
- General-purpose programming language
- *De facto* standard language used for machine learning, statistics, physics, biology, AI, ...
- Powers Reddit, Bitbucket, Dropbox, Sublime Text, BitTorrent, Blender, Sage, Linux, Civilization IV, Django, GIMP, YouTube...

# What we're going to do

We're going to learn how to do basic things in Python:
- Make decisions
- Do things repeatedly
- Work with data
- Use NumPy to work with data *better*
- Use MatPlotLib to make pretty pictures of data
- Read documentation

After this, you should have some background to help you out when you need to solve a programming task.

---

# Outline

- Fundamentals
- Types, lists, strings, and methods
- Expressions, `print`
- `if`, `while`, and `for`
- Files and data
- NumPy
- MatPlotLib

## Installing Python

You should have Python 3.5 already installed. If you don't:
- Windows: [Download and run this installer.](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1-amd64.exe)
- Mac OS X: [Download and run this installer.](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1-macosx10.6.pkg)
- Linux: You probably already have Python!

---

.rightimg[![IDLE](idle.png)]

## Running Python

1. Open IDLE3 or IDLE.
2. You're running Python

---

## Getting around IDLE

.rightimg[![Shell](shell.png)]

### Shell

This is the shell. You can use it to *interact* with Python code that you've already written.

How do you interact with it? ...With more Python code. **:D**

You can enter **expressions** into it and Python will evaluate them, then tell you the answer (in blue).

---

## Getting around IDLE

.rightimg[![File editor](editor.png)]

### File editor

In the shell window: File > New File

This is where you write code. Save files with a `.py` file extension (you'll have to type it in yourself) and you'll get **syntax highlighting**.

To run code, a) save it, b) Run > Run Module. If you're on Windows, you can also hit F5.

---

layout: false

# Comments

Lines that start with a `#` are ignored by Python. You can (and should) use this to describe how your code works to anyone reading your code.

```python
# This is a comment
# This is another comment
# Python is pretty good

some_code_here()  # I can also put comments at the end of lines of code
```

---

layout: true

# Basics

---

Programming is a glorified way of manipulating **values**. Different kinds of values have different **types** and are represented in different ways.

```python
1  # int
1.0  # float
"hello"  # str
True  # bool
```

---

You can combine values with **operators** to make new values.

```python
1 + 2  # is 3
1.0 + 2  # is 3.0
1 / 2  # is 0.5
"hello" + "world"  # is "helloworld"
True and False  # is False
```

Operators work on different types. `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` work on numbers in ways you would expect; `and` and `or` work on `bool`s and let you do logic.

(also there's heaps more operators)

---

.rightimg[![Shell basics](shell2.png)]

You can try this out in the shell.

---

layout: false

# Strings

Strings are sequences of characters.

```python
"hello"
"world"
"this is me"
```

You can add them together. You can also slice them:

```python
"this is me"[0]  # "t"
"this is me"[1]  # "h"
"this is me"[1:3]  # "hi"
```

If you just put a single number in the brackets, you will get a single character back. Note that `0` is the first character.

If you put two numbers separated by `:`, you will get multiple characters back. If you put in `[i:j]`, you will get back the `i`th character up to (but *not including*) the `j`th character.

---

# Lists

Lists are sequences of values. They can have whatever you want in them and be as long as you like. They are a bunch of values surrounded by square brackets.

```python
[1, 2, 3]
["hello", "world", "this is me"]
[1, 2, "hello", "world"]
[True, True, False]
[]
```

Just like strings, they can be sliced.
```python
[1, 2, "hello", "world"][0]  # 1
[1, 2, "hello", "world"][1]  # 2
[1, 2, "hello", "world"][1:3]  # [2, "hello"]
```

---

# Printing

If you try adding some numbers in Python's shell (or whatever), Python tells you what the result is. But if you type code into its own file, and then run that with Python, Python won't tell you anything. You have to explicitly tell Python to output information. You do this with `print`.

```python
print("Hello world!")
print(1 + 2)
```

---

# Variables

We want to store our values somewhere, so that we can reuse them (and also so that we don't have to jam all our maths onto one line). **Variables** are how we do this:

```python
x = 1
result = x + 2
print(result)  # prints 3
```

Variables can be named any sequence of letters and underscores. Note that you can change their values later:
```python
x = 1
# x is 1
x = 2
# x is now 2
```

You can even change their values based on their current values.
```python
x = 1
x = x + 1
# x is now 2
```

---

layout: true

# Making decisions

---

You can compare values with **boolean operators**:

```python
# here, x and y are variables
x == y  # equality
x != y  # inequality
x > y  # greater than
x < y  # less than
x >= y  # greater than or equal to
x <= y  # less than or equal to
```

Python turns these into `True` or `False`.

```python
x = 1
y = 2

print(x != y)  # prints True
```

---

You can make Python do different things depending on whether something is `True` or `False` using an **if statement**.

```python
x = True

if x:
  print("x is True!")
else:
  print("x is False!")
  # you can have lots f lines inside if/else
  # just keep indenting them
```

All the code that runs inside the `if` statement must be indented &mdash; this just means you should put a tab or two spaces in front of each line.

---

Inside the `if` statements you can put whatever code you want (including more `if` statements).

```python
y = 100

x = 0

if y < 80:
  z = 1200
  x = z + 1
else:
  x = 4

print(x)  # what does this print? hint: it prints 4
```

---

layout: true

# Making decisions (repeatedly)

---

If you want to do something over and over again until something happens, you need a `while` loop. `while` loops are exactly like `if` statements, except that when Python gets to the end of the code inside them, it jumps back up to the start, checks whether the condition is `True` again, and then maybe runs the whole loop again (and repeat).

```python
x = 0
while x < 10:
  x = x + 1
  print(x)
```

```python
while True:
  # this runs forever!
  print("hello")
```

Just like with `if`s, you need to indent all the code that goes inside a `while` loop. You can put whatever code you want inside `while` loops (including more `while` loops or `if` statements... etc).

---

layout: false

# .aside[Fun computer science fact]

You can now write Python programs that compute *literally any computable values*!

- variables
- `if`
- `while`

*Technically* all you need!

--

...though we should do more real-world stuff. First stop, `for` loops!

---

# `for` loops

If you have a list of things, and you want to run some code for each thing in the list, you use a `for` loop.

```python
my_cool_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for item in my_cool_list:
  print(item * item)
```

In the above code, `item` is a variable. You can call it whatever you want.

---

# Nested `for` loops

Maybe you have a list of lists.

```python
z = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```

And you want to do something to all of the elements in all of the lists.

```python
for sublist in z:
  for item in sublist:
    print(item)
```

.sidenote[Of course, when would we ever have a list of lists...?

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 & 3\\\\
  4 & 5 & 6\\\\
  7 & 8 & 9\\\\
\end{bmatrix}

# Working with data

To work with data, we could do things the hard way, or we could not do things the hard way. For the purposes of this workshop, we are not doing things the hard way.

## NumPy

NumPy is the Python community's answer to not doing things the hard way. You'll need to install it:

- On Mac OS X, `sudo pip3 install numpy` should work.
- On Windows, [download this](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/djcobkfp/numpy-1.11.0rc1+mkl-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl), save it to your C: drive and rename it to `numpy.whl`, then open command prompt and run `cd C:\Python35\Scripts\pip.exe install C:\numpy.whl`.
- On Ubuntu or Debian, `sudo apt-get install python3-numpy` should work.

(This is a one-time setup thing...)

# Using NumPy

Put this at the top of your code:

```python
import numpy
```

This tells Python that we want to use NumPy. Let's load some data. Specifically, [this data](population_data.csv), via data.act.gov.au.
```csv
Year,Projected Population - Male,Projected Population - Female,Total Persons,Aged 0-14 years,Aged 15-64 years,Aged 65+ years,Median age,Growth - Persons p.a.,Growth - % p.a.
2009,174999,177190,352189,18.4%,71.4%,10.2%,33.7,,
2010,178055,179903,357958,18.3%,71.3%,10.4%,33.8,5769,1.6%
```

Loading it is easy:
```python
# 0, 3, and 7 are year, total persons, and median age, respectively
population_data = numpy.genfromtxt("population_data.csv", delimiter=",",
                                   names=True, usecols=[0, 3, 7])
```

(This kind of code will deal with nicely formatted CSVs. If your CSVs are not nice, then you will have to work a bit harder, but that's outside of scope.)

---

# Can we use loops with it?

You bet. It's basically a list of lists &mdash; one list of rows, and then each row is a list itself.

```python
for row in population_data:
  year = row[0]
  pop = row[1]
  age = row[2]

  print(year)
```

<!-- TODO: Plots! Regression! -->

<!-- 
# Magic

Convert the CSV file into something called an array:

```python
population_data = numpy.array(population_data.tolist())
```

You now have something that's a lot like a matrix. You can slice it like a list, but you also have the ability to  -->

# Data and types

---

## A crash-course in types

What is a type?
- Types tell you what properties some data have
- Types tell you what you can do to that data
- All data have a type
- All data with a particular type behave the same way

---

## A crash-course in types

Common examples:
- `3` is an `Integer`
- `1.21` is a `Float`
  - `3.0` is also a `Float`
- `True` is a `Bool`
- `'h'` is a `Char`

If we need to write down what type some data is, we use `::` .
- `3 :: Integer` means "`3` is an `Integer`"
- `1.21 :: Float` means "`1.21` is a `Float`"
- `True :: Bool` means "`True` is a `Bool`"
- `'h' :: Char` means "`'h'` is a `Char`"

---

## Numeric types

**`Integer`**. Whole numbers. You can add them, multiply them, and subtract them:
```haskell
1 + 2
2 * 5
7 - 4
```

**`Float`**. Decimal numbers. You can add them, multiply them, subtract them, and divide them:
```haskell
1.134 + 2.4
2.3 * 5.0
7.1 - 4.34567
8.5 / 4.0
```

---

## .aside[Aside: ] Syntax

Comments:
```haskell
-- haskell will ignore this line
```

Order of operations:
```haskell
4 * (2 + 3) -- use parentheses to change evaluation order
```

---

## Booleans

**`Boolean`**. Either `True` or `False`.
Used for logic.

```haskell
coolResult = if x &lt; 4
             then 100000 * 34
             else 15
```

You can make booleans by doing comparisons like `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `==`, and `/=`, and you can also just write `True` and `False`.

---

## Lists

Lists are ordered collections of data. We write a list with square brackets, and separate the data in the list with commas.
```haskell
[1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 11]
```

All data in the list must be the same type!

Lists are data, too, so they have a type. The type of a list is the type of whatever is in the list, surrounded by square brackets.
```haskell
[1, 2, 3] :: [Integer] -- a list of Integers
[True, False, False, True, False] :: [Bool] -- a list of Bools
[[1, 3, 5], [1], [2, 3]] :: [[Integer]] -- a list of lists of Integers!
```

# Functions


---

## Functions in Haskell

In other languages, you *call* a function, and the function *does stuff*. In Haskell, you *apply* functions to data, and they *transform* that data in some way. Your whole program becomes one big function evaluation.

- No loops, just functions
- No variables, just input and output
- Sadness, tears, and pain

---

## Like in mathematics!

Here's a mathematical function definition:
$$parabola(x) = x^2$$

Here's how you'd use that:
$$parabola(2) \rightarrow 2^2 \rightarrow 4$$

Here's the same function definition in Haskell:
```haskell
parabola x = x^2
```

Here's how you'd use that:
```haskell
parabola 2 -- same as 2^2 from the definition -- 4
```

---

## Applying functions to data

Say I have a function `addOne` that takes one number and adds `1` to it. To use that function, I just write:
```haskell
addOne 4
addOne 8
addOne 100
```
and these would become `5`, `9`, and `101` respectively.

Say I have a function `add` that takes two numbers and adds them together.

To use that function, I just write:
```haskell
add 1 3
add 5 2
add 8 6
```
and these would become `4`, `7`, and `14` respectively.

---

## Some basic, standard functions

On numbers:
- `mod`, integer remainder of two numbers
- `div`, integer division of two numbers
- `negate`, negates one number
- `even`, checks if a number is even
- `odd`, checks if a number is odd
- `pi` is a function that takes *no* arguments and gives a number back
- `sqrt` is a function that takes a `Float` and gives its square root back

**Try using them!** The syntax is:
```haskell
function arg1 arg2 arg3 ...

odd 5 -- for example
```

---

## Some basic, standard functions

On lists:
- `head` takes a list and gives you the first thing in it
- `last` takes a list and gives you the last thing in it
- `tail` takes a list and gives you a list of everything but the first thing in it
- `init` takes a list and gives you a list of everything but the last thing in it
- `reverse` takes a list and reverses it
- `take` takes a number `\(n\)` and a list, and gives you back the first `\(n\)` things from that list

(Lists are much more interesting than numbers!)

**Try these too!** Remember, list syntax is
```haskell
['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```

---

## Writing functions

Writing functions is pretty much just like you would write them in mathematics.

```haskell
addOne n = n + 1
add x y = x + y
```

Now we're getting somewhere. **Try defining your own** &mdash; a classic example is to implement the quadratic formula:
$$x(a, b, c) = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

--

```haskell
x a b c = (-b + sqrt (b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a)

x 1 3 1 -- -0.3819660112501051
```

---

## Function types

If you want to refer to a function, you just use its name: `sqrt`, `addOne`, `even`, `head`, `tail`...

In Haskell, functions are data! Since they're data, they also have types. The type of a function `f` that takes one `Integer` and returns a `Char` looks like this:
```haskell
f :: Integer -> Char
```

Reasonably intuitive! The type of a function `f` that takes *any* type and then returns something of the same type looks like this:
```haskell
f :: a -> a
```
(Note that `a` is lowercase &mdash; it's just a placeholder. We could also have used `b`, `any`, `sometype`...)

---

## Function types

Here are some types for functions we've already seen:
```haskell
even :: Integer -> Bool
odd :: Integer -> Bool
head :: [a] -> a
tail :: [a] -> [a]
sqrt :: Float -> Float
```

---

## Function types

What if we have multiple arguments? The `div` function takes two `Integer`s divides them, and returns the integer part of the result. Its type looks like this:
```haskell
div :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
```

`take` takes an `Integer` and a list of any type, and gives back a list of the same type. Its type looks like this:
```haskell
take :: Integer -> [a] -> [a]
```

<!-- The astute readers amongst you, presumably the ones reading this source code, will note that the type of `take` isn't actually `Integer -> [a] -> [a]`, it's `Int -> [a] -> [a]`. However, the distinction between Integer and Int is beyond the scope of this talk. -->

The basic format, then, is to just chain together the types of all your arguments with `->` separating them, then put another `->`, then put the return type.

.sidenote[(There's a fantastic reason for this weird syntax; I'll explain it if we get time.)]

---

## Function types

When you write a function, Haskell can guess its types. But it's good practice to put the types above each function, like so:
```haskell
addOne :: Integer -> Integer
addOne x = x + 1
```

# Branching

Branching is when you do different things based on a condition. There are three main ways this is done in Haskell.

```haskell
x = if y == 2
    then 2
    else (y + 1000)
```
The `if` here is an *expression* &mdash; it itself has a value, unlike in Python or C where an `if` is a *statement* controlling program flow.

```haskell
x
  | y == 2 = 2
  | y &gt;= 10 = y - 10
  | otherwise = y + 1000
```
This is called a "guard"; you can use any `Bool` on the left of the `=` sign and the expression on the right is returned for the first `True` left-hand side.

---

# Branching

The third way is called *pattern matching*. We need to know more about types to cover it properly, but the basic idea is that you replace one of your function arguments with a *pattern*. At the simplest level, this might just be a value. Then, that particular function definition only runs if the pattern is matched by the input values. If your data contains other data (like a list), then you can also match using placeholders, and Haskell will store the corresponding data in those placeholders (check the code below for an example).

```haskell
myDivision :: Float -> Float -> Float
myDivision a 0.0 = 10000000.0 -- basically infinity, right?
myDivision a b = a/b

-- usage examples
myDivision 1.0 0.0 -- 10000000.0
myDivision 1.0 2.0 -- 0.5
```

```haskell
contrivedList :: [Integer] -> Integer
contrivedList [] = 0
contrivedList [x, y] = x + y
contrivedList list = head list

-- usage example
contrivedList [1, 2] -- 3
```

---

# Recursion

In Haskell, there are no loops. Instead, you just define functions in terms of themselves. Here is how you might implement factorial:

```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)
```

This is called *recursion*.

We can also use recursion to do things with lists, but we need to know more pattern matching for that.

# List Patterns

---

We'll cover list patterns quickly here so you can try them out, then we'll come back after we do some more stuff with types.

Haskell has an operator called `:` and it prepends things to lists:
```haskell
1 : [] == [1]
1 : [2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]
1 : 2 : [3] == [1, 2, 3]
1 : 2 : 3 : [] == [1, 2, 3]
```

You can use this in patterns to "unprepend". For example, `1 : rest` matches any list starting with `1`, and then stores the rest of the list in `rest`.
```haskell
-- this function cuts off the first 1 from a list
contrived :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
contrived (1:rest) = rest
contrived list = list

-- usage examples
contrived [1, 2, 3] -- [2, 3]
contrived [2, 3, 4] -- [2, 3, 4]
```

---

We can also use placeholders instead of literal values, e.g. `first : rest` &mdash; here, Haskell would match any list with at least one thing in it, store the first thing in `first`, and the rest in `rest`. We could use this to implement `head`! **Try this yourself!** Remember, `head` takes a list and returns the first thing in it.

```haskell
head :: [a] -> a
```
--
```haskell
head (first:rest) = first
```

---

Now, we have the tools to do really interesting things to lists. Let's try writing a function that returns the last thing in a list.

If we have exactly one thing in the list, then our list would be something of the form `[x]` and the last element is `x`, so we can write that down:
```haskell
last :: [a] -> a
last [x] = x
```

If we have more than one thing in the list, then we really only need to cut off the first thing and get the last thing in the rest of the list.
```haskell
last (first:rest) = last rest
```
And that's it! Note that Haskell will try and match these patterns in order, so if you put `(first:rest)` first, it'll match `x:[]` and you'll try calling `last` on an empty list.

# Defining types

---

Haskell uses *algebraic data types*, meaning you can combine different types to make new types. You could (if you wanted to) define `Bool` like this:
```haskell
data Bool = True | False
```
This line defines a new type called `Bool`. `|` can be read as "or" or "union"; this kind of type is called a *union type*. Another example:
```haskell
data TemperatureUnit = Celsius | Fahrenheit | Kelvin
```
`Celsius` etcetera are literal values, so you can just use them in your code.

```haskell
temperatureSystem :: [Char] -> TemperatureUnit
temperatureSystem country = if country == ['U', 'S', 'A']
                            then Fahrenheit
                            else Celsius
```

---

## .aside[Aside: ] Deriving `Show` for sanity

When you make a type, Haskell assumes that there's no way to print it out, ever. You can tell it to try and guess how to print out your type:
```haskell
data TemperatureUnit = Celsius | Fahrenheit | Kelvin
  deriving (Show)
```

Now you can use your type in Haskell and Haskell won't get confused when you return values of the type. If you get errors like `No instance for (Show Temperature) arising from a use of 'print'`, you probably haven't derived `Show`.

---

You can also combine multiple kinds of data into one type:
```haskell
data Temperature = Temp Float TemperatureUnit

-- example
Temp 100.0 Celsius
```
`Temperature` is the name of the type, and `Temp` here is called a *type constructor* &mdash; it's how we tell Haskell that we're talking about a `Temperature` rather than just putting random words down.

This is called a *product type*.

---

You can combine union and product types to make even more types. This one is either an `Integer` or a `Char`:
```haskell
data EitherIntOrChar = EitherInteger Integer | EitherChar Char
```
`EitherInteger` and `EitherChar` are type constructors. If we didn't have those, then Haskell couldn't tell that we're using `EitherIntOrChar` types instead of `Integer`s or `Char`s. To use this type, you'd just have to put one of the constructors in front of the associated value:
```haskell
EitherInteger 1 :: EitherIntOrChar
EitherChar 'h' :: EitherIntOrChar
[EitherChar 'h', EitherChar 'e', EitherInteger 1,
                 EitherInteger 1, EitherChar 'o'] :: [EitherIntOrChar]
```

---

Maybe we have a function that returns a number sometimes, but might break sometimes &mdash; maybe a function that gets the square root of a number, but instead returns some special value if the number we put in is negative.

```haskell
maybeSqrt :: Float -> Float
maybeSqrt x = if x &gt;= 0
              then sqrt x
              else ???
```

But what can we return? We shouldn't return a `Float` because then we couldn't distinguish it from an actual answer. Maybe we can make a new type:
```haskell
data MaybeFloat = Yes Float | NoFloat
```
So something in our new data type is either a `Yes Float`, or it's `NoFloat`. Example values in this type:
```haskell
Yes 10.0
Yes 234.23
Yes pi
NoFloat
```

---

Now, we can use our new type.

```haskell
maybeSqrt :: Float -> MaybeFloat
maybeSqrt x = if x &gt;= 0
              then Yes (sqrt x)
              else NoFloat
```

---

We can generalise this to work with any type, not just `Float`s, by using a *type variable*:
```haskell
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
```

I've changed the names from `Yes` and `NoFloat` to `Just` and `Nothing`, because Haskell actually includes this type for you. It's called the `Maybe` type.

`a` can be whatever type you want, so we can rewrite `maybeSqrt` using this.
```haskell
maybeSqrt :: Float -> Maybe Float
maybeSqrt x = if x &gt;= 0
              then Just (sqrt x)
              else Nothing
```

This is commonly used to handle errors.

---

## Types and pattern matching

Pattern matching can be used to break down a type. For example, say we have a `Maybe Integer` and we want to add one to it if there's a number in it, and return `Nothing` if not.
```haskell
maybeAddOne :: Maybe Integer -> Maybe Integer
maybeAddOne Nothing = Nothing
maybeAddOne (Just something) = Just (something + 1)
```

You can compare this to the definition to see how pattern matching lets you break down types.
```haskell
data Maybe Integer = Nothing | Just Integer
```

---

## Recursive type definitions

You can define a type in terms of itself. Such a type is called a *recursive type*. Lists, it turns out, are recursive, and you can define them like this:
```haskell
data List a = EmptyList | Prepend a (List a)
```

Or, rewriting this with list syntax:
```haskell
data [a] = [] | a : [a]
```

Now you might be able to see why pattern matching can use `:` to break down a list.

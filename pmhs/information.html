					Port Macquarie High School educates around 800 students from Year 7 to Year 12. Our location between the beaches and town allows us to run a wide variety of activities as part of our curriculum. <br>For a map of the school, <a href="static/schoolmap.jpg" target="_blank">click here.</a>
					<h2>Education</h2>
					<img src="static/bandsixes.jpg" class="right marginless">
					Port Macquarie High School aims to provide a strong and supportive learning environment for all students.<br>
					The school library contains both fiction and non-fiction texts, along with two classrooms of computers, a senior study area, and senior study computers. It is open at lunchtime most days for junior students, and senior students are able to use the library in any study period.<br>
					Many classrooms are fitted with interactive whiteboards to enhance learning, and the school's connected classroom allows distance education students to regularly conference with their teachers at other schools.<br>
					Students are encouraged to read with our ‘Read Every Day’ program. Each morning during roll call students take out a book or magazine and read it for twenty minutes before their first class.<br>
					For details on the courses available at Port High <a href="curriculum.html">see here</a>.
					<h2>Sport</h2>
					<img src="static/sportsfield.jpg" class="left marginless">
					We have a wide range of sporting activities available at Port High. Every Wednesday during periods 5 and 6 our juniors participate in a sport of their choosing. This is either a paid sport outside of school or a free sport within the school grounds. Our school also enters a number of competitive sports, having representative teams in sports such as soccer and basketball.
					<h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>
					<img src="static/awards.jpg" class="right marginless">
					Our school encourages participation in a range of extracurricular activities, including drama, debating, and public speaking. There is also a school concert band. We have previously represented in the Schools Spectacular, and Rock Eisteddfod. Students frequently enter competitions (academic, performing arts), for example public speaking and Tournament of the Minds.
					<h2>Citizenship and Fundraising</h2>
					<img src="static/mpcsolar.jpg" class="left marginless">
					The school has a proud history of citizenship achievements and participations, such as entering and winning the Vampire Shield and participating in Shave for a Cure every year. The school also enjoys an annual themed walkathon along Lighthouse Beac, in which all students and staff are encouraged to dress up. There are many dress-up day fundraisers - like our Crazy Day, which is a school favourite. The environment team works hard at keeping our school eco-friendly (cleaning up the school, organising recycling bins, planting trees etc.) and our Student Representative Council (SRC) has elected members from each year group.
